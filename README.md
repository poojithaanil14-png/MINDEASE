### Project Description
[MindEase is a Flask-powered journaling app that helps users monitor their mental health. Unlike a plain notebook, it detects your mood as you write and offers immediate motivational support based on how you’re feeling today.]

### The Problem statement
[Many students struggle to express emotions.Existing journaling apps feel overwhelming.We built a minimal,emotionally safe digital journal that makes reflection simple and accessible.]

### The Solution
[We solved the problem of emotional tracking by building a Flask-based web application that uses state-management to provide real-time motivational support. By combining a Mood-First data entry system with a Dockerized backend, we created a reliable, empathetic tool for daily mental health management.]

Client Layer: The user interacts with a responsive frontend built with HTML5 and CSS3, styled with a focus on mental wellness.

Server Layer: A Flask (Python) backend handles the logic, including user session management and mood-based conditional routing.

Data Layer: Journal entries and mood metadata are persisted in a JSON file system for lightweight, efficient data handling.

Infrastructure: The entire application is containerized using Docker and deployed via Render, ensuring a consistent environment from development to production

**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow](docs/workflow.png)
Authentication: The user logs in via the centered login card.

Mood Selection: Before journaling, the user selects their current emotional state (Happy, Neutral, or Sad).

Data Submission: The journal entry and mood are sent to the /add route via a POST request.

Persistence & Analysis: The backend appends the entry to entries.json and analyzes the last_mood value.

Motivational Feedback: The system redirects the user to the entries page, where a dynamic Jinja2 template displays a personalized motivational message based on the analyzed mood.

- **Description:** [What it does]
- **Parameters:**
  - `param1` (string): [Description]
  - `param2` (integer): [Description]
- **Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {}
}

### For Mobile Apps:

#### App Flow Diagram

![App Flow](docs/app-flow.png)
1. Authentication Stage
User Action: The user arrives at the landing page and enters their username into the login card.

Backend Process: Flask captures the username and stores it in a session variable, allowing the app to "remember" the user as they move between pages.

2. Data Entry & Mood Selection
User Action: On the journal page, the user first selects their current emotion (Happy, Neutral, or Sad) from the dropdown and then writes their thoughts in the text area.

Layout Benefit: By placing the mood picker first, the app helps the user identify their emotional state before they begin the descriptive writing process.

3. Processing & Persistence
User Action: The user clicks the "Save Entry" button.

Backend Process: The form data is sent to the /add route, where the Python script appends the new entry (including the user's name, text, and mood) to the entries.json file.

4. Dynamic Feedback & History
User Action: The user is automatically redirected to the Entries History page.

Backend Process: The app runs a conditional check on the most recent mood saved.

Outcome: If the last mood was "Sad," the user sees a supportive message; if "Happy," they receive an encouraging celebration of their mood.
